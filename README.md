# Waste Collection Game
VR Waste Collection Game made for EPA Coast Guard Training events.

This game provides a short, partially randomized, and interactive demonstration of waste management principles. 

Unity Combined with Meta Quest 2 were used to create an interactive experience of sorting random items into the correct bin.

To use on Meta Quest 2 headsets, download the apk file from the most recent release and install it on your VR device. The recomended tool is Meta Quest Developer Hub. 
	To use, download from https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/, and run the installer after unpacking the zipped folder. 
	Once the program is running, use the charging cord that comes with the headset or some other data transfer cable for the Quest 2 and plug your headset into the computer. 
		You may need to confirm some prompts in the headset to allow the computer to connect to it and transfer data, so make sure the headset is on when you plug it in. 
	Once the app identifies the headset, select your headset in the Device Manager tab. 
	From here, open File Explorer to where the apk file is downloaded, and drag the file from Explorer into Meta Quest Developer Hub. 
		As you are dragging the file over, 2 options for what to do with the file will appear, drop the file on the option on the right. 
		You should see a progress bar appear as the program gets installed. 
	After this, you are free to unplug the headset and open the app. 
	In the headset's App Library menu, there will be a dropdown selection at the top of the screen. Select the dropdown and shoose Unknown Source.
	Collection Game should appear in this menu, simply click it to launch the program.
The program has not been tested on other headsets. If attempting to install and run on other devices, proceed with caution.

To play, use the grip button (lower button on the back of the controller) on the controller to grab objects. In the starting room, grab one of the 3 cards to apply that card's random value to its connected process. Once you grab a card, you will be put in a room with 3 bins with labels above them, as well as a chute going down into the room behind you. As items fall down the chute, you need to place them in the correct bin so that the items can be disposed of. You will have 2 minutes to dispose of as many items as you can, at which point your total score will be displayed along with an option to play again, which will bring you back to the starting room and allow you to select a card again, each of wwhich will have a new random value.
